            <div id="biography">
                <p>I worked for several years in the eCommerce field, using various apps and platforms needed to run an online store and business. <a class="readMoreBtn" href="#biography">Read more...</a><span class=readMore>As expected, I sometimes ran into issues with current eCommerce solutions, so curiosity and a passion for solving problems lead me to begin a course with Thinkful in their Engineering Flex Program.</span></p>
                <div class="readMore">        
                    <p>Although I’ve gone to the “other side,” I’ve still taken along with me the business-focused part of my brain. I understand that, although user interface is important and impressive, what is more important is giving the client a web-site which gives the target audience a beneficial user experience that brings about the desired results.</p>
                    <p>I was raised with a deep passion for music. It hasn't been my main source of income for a long time, but I still try to spend time on music whenever I can. I have made freindships with local artists and film makers, with whom I collaborate--recording music in my own home on a PC I built for audio production. Through films and art exhibits my music has been heard all over the world.
